Docker Compose is a tool for running multi-container applications on Docker
defined using the [Compose file format](https://compose-spec.io).
A Compose file is used to define how one or more containers that make up
your application are configured.
Once you have a Compose file, you can create and start your application with a
single command: `docker compose up`.
